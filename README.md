# Bookbot

BookBot is a very simple command line tool which takes a book (as .txt) as input and print the number of words that it contains as well the number of times a given character occurs within it. 

It only works with text files. No .epub or .pdf files. Maybe I will expand it to these file types as an added practice in the future. 

## How to use:

To run simply copy this repo to your computer:

```
git clone https://github.com/jacobdanielrose/bookbot.git
```

and run the command:

```
python3 main.py <path_to_book_file>
```

This may or may not work with python 2 (I never tested it but it's {INSERT CURRENT YEAR HERE}, you should really be using python3).

BookBot is my first project as part of the [Boot.dev](https://www.boot.dev) back-end developer path.
